A Handibot tool is a new kind of portable, digitally-controlled power tool for cutting, drilling, carving, and many other machining operations– the first Universal Digital Power Tool (UDPT) – or just, a Smart Tool. If you're familiar with industrial CNC (computer numerically controlled) equipment, think of the Handibot tool as a portable version of CNC. But instead of taking material to a stationary machine, you bring the Handibot to your material -- your jobsite, your remodeling task, your project, your work.

You can put your Handibot tool to work on a table, the floor, the ceiling, the wall, wherever you need to precisely cut, drill, or carve. Armed with a software application developed just for the kind of job you need to do, a Handibot tool is ready to go to work on your job, task, or project with a squeeze of the “Start” button.

Open Source
===========
Handibot is an “open innovation” project. Handibot runs on the open-source, [FabMo digital fabrication platform](https://gofabmo.org). And, to encourage the evolution of hardware and accessories, Handibots are open source hardware (OSH or OSHW). This GitHub repository is the definitive open source hardware documentation for the Handibot system.

The philosophy of this open-source project and our plans for its development can be found on the [Handibot website Open-Innovation pages](https://handibot.com/open-source.php#open_innovation). We recognize that hardware sources and documentation placed on GitHub, while properly archival, can be difficult to view. So as a supplement, we additionally place the definitive STP files as well as additional production files and documents on more exploration-friendly sites which we strive to keep current.

At the moment, Handibot materials can be explored on [GrabCAD](https://workbench.grabcad.com/workbench/projects/gcuAc_g79JwJj5xoyB_sCtAKoUyXaXH0NyeRYptWOwEOWN#/space/gc7w847Pt4uE0Y2-VXNzofMmxgbYGKxMjhjdYk3aCMUUWK/folder/2032714).
