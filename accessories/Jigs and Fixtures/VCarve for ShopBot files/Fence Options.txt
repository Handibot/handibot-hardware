Handibot Fence options

Two options for a fixed front fence for a Handibot Smart Power Tool. The edge of the fences line up with the Y=0 point of the tool when zeroed with the homing switches, which gives an accurate reference point for cutting.

Two options are shown for a replaceable sacrificial section in the section where cutting happens...a press-fit insert that is cut with the Handibot, and a 1/4" thick insert that is attached with double-sided carpet tape.

The parts are cut with a 1/4" diameter bit and the file has two layers. The "t-nut pocket" layer contains shallow recesses for the two t-nuts and should be run first. The "Cutout" layer drills holes and cuts out the fence.

After the cutting is complete, press or hammer two t-nuts into the recess in the bottom, then flip the fence over and bolt it to the front edge of the Handibot using the two bolt holes in the yellow base.

NOTE:The right-most flange of the clear acrylic base lines up with the right-most bolt hole in the front of the yellow base, and even though the heads of the bolts are low profile there is a chance that the flange may hit the bolt head. If that looks like it's going to happen on your tool, the front edge of that flange can be filed or ground a little to give clearance.
