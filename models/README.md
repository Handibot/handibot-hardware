Handibot Base Model (STP) History
=================================
(We have selected STP files to provide the definitive versions of Handibot. Along with PDF BOM's in a separate folder, they consititute the reference design for Handibots and are stored here on GitHub. We will make other types of models, documentation, and production files available as appropriate and convenient. These we will strive to keep updated and available at sites that make exploration convenient.)
